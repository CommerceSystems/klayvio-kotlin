There are limits placed onto the size of the data present. This must not exceed 5 MB. This must not exceed 300 event properties. A single string cannot be larger than 100 KB.

 * @param `value` A numeric, monetary value to associate with this event. For example, the dollar amount of a purchase.
 * @param valueCurrency The ISO 4217 currency code of the value associated with the event.
 * @param uniqueId A unique identifier for an event. If the unique_id is repeated for the same profile and metric, only the first processed event will be recorded. If this is not present, this will use the time to the second. Using the default, this limits only one event per profile per second.
